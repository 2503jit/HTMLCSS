Asynchronous Javascript: Asynchronous Javascript means some functions/actions which takes some time to execute. it will execute the certain parts of the code asynchronosly. 
   -->Better Performance
   --> Improve responsiveness
   --> simplify the code

we can perform Asynchronous actions in JS using 3 ways
i. callbacks: Callbacks are the functions which are given in another function parameters. To use callbacks for Asynchronous JS, we can use Timers
  i. setTimeOut(callback,time in ms):
     This function will execute its callback after the time is over only
     eg: setTimeOut(function(){
        console.log("hello world")
     },1000)

  ii. setInterval(callback,time in ms)
     This function will execute its callback for every time of given time is over 
 eg: setInterval(function(){
        console.log("hello world")
     },1000)

To stop setTimeout or setInterval, we have timeStoppers i.e., clearTimeout and clearInterval
    clearTimeout: it is used to remove/clear the traces of setTimeout using its object value
    clearInterval: it is used to remove/clear the traces of setInterval using its object value








ii. Promises
iii. async await
