Javascript is  dynamically typed language
In Javascript , the type of a variable changes accordign to value it holds. Basic data types are categorized as two types
  primitve data types
  non-primitive data types

i. primitive data types: these data types are considered purely based on the value. The most used primitive are 
  a. number: Any numerical value is a number
   eg: let x=20.3152;
   console.log(typeof x) //number
   number types have some default methods like

    toFixed(noOfDecimalDigits): results number with certain number of DecimalDigits rounded
    eg: let n= 2.1548, 
    console.log(n.toFixed(2)) //2.16

    toPrecision(totalNoOfDigits): results number with total number of digits rounded.
    let n=23.4156
    console.log(n.toPrecision(3)) //23.

    toString(baseValue): toString will convert given number into string of another base
    let n=23;
    n.toString(2)  -- converts n into binary --10111

    numbers can also have special default methods called math methods
