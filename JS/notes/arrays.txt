Arrays are used to store elements. Array is a collection of elements.
eg: let arr = [5,44,6,3]
arr[0] = 5;
arr[1]=44
....

length is a method of array which returns total number of elements in the array.


// Arrays methods:
i. push(): push is used to insert a value into the array as last value
  eg: array.push(values)
ii. pop(): pop is used to remove only the ending value of the array
  eg: array.pop()
iii. unshift() : unshift is used to insert value/values into the array as first value
  eg: array.unshift(values)
iv. shift(): shift is used to remove only starting value of the array
  eg: array.shift()
v. splice(starting_index,deleteCount,insertValues)
   it is used to delete any number of values or insert any number of values to the array
   eg: let arr= [5,4,6,7];
       arr.splice(1)  -- will delete whole array from index 1
       arr.splice(1,2) -- will delete 2 values from index 1
       arr.splice(1,2,"shekar") -- will delete 2 values from 
       index 1 and add shekhar at index 1
vi. reverse() : reverse is used to reverse the array.
   array.reverse();
vii. includes : includes is used to check whether the value is included
   in the array or not
   array.includes(value)
viii. forEach(callback): forEach is a method of array which accepts callback function as paramater and will apply the function to each and every element of the array
arr2.forEach(function (x,ind)
{
    let i = x * x;
    arr3[ind] = i;
})
console.log(arr3)
