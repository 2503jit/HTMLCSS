API (Application Programming Interface):
    It acts like a bridge between frontend and backend where backend sends the data to frontend by endpoints.
  eg: swiggy gets google locations or netflix gets geolocation etc..,
APIs are used for typically httpRequests such as GET,POST,PUT,DELETE etc..,

How to use API's?
   In olden times , we used to work with API's using XHR(xmlHttpRequests), but now browsers have default method called fetch which also works XHR only underneath
   fetch is a web api which is used for HttpRequests. fetch returns Promise. A Promise is a object which have three states(pending,fulfilled,rejected) and it descibes eventual completion of asynchronous operation

  Promises are resolved by then and catch blocks. Fulfilled state of a promise triggers then block and rejected state of a promise triggers catch block
 
eg:  fetch(url)
          .then(function(res){
                 // success code of a promise  with 'res' response     
           }
          .catch(function(err){
               // rejected code of a promise with 'err' error
           }

  promises can be combined one after the other called promise chaining
    eg: Promise
                 .then(()=> newPromise)
                 .then(()=> resolve)
                 .catch(()=>catchLogic)
