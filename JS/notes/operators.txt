Operators in Javascript are used to perform certain operations on operands. They are:
i. Arithematic operators:
    Arithematic operators are used for arithematic calculations such as addition,subtraction,multiplication etc..,
    + - used for addition
    - - used for subtraction
    * - used for multiplication
    / - used for division
    % - used for remainder
    ** - used for power
2. Relational operators: These operators are used for comparison and returns always boolean
      a>b - checks a is greater than b or not and returns boolean
      a<b - checks whether a is less than b or not and returns boolean
      a>=b - chcecks whether a is greater than or equals to b or not
      a<=b - checks whether a is less than or equals to b or not
      a==b - compares whether a is equals to b or not. it will not compare data type
      a===b - compares whether a is equals to b or not. it will also compares data type
      a!=b - compares whether a is not equals to b  or not. it will also not compares the data type
      a!==b - compares whether a is not quals to b or not . it will also compares the data type.

  3. logical operators: logical operators are used to perform logical operations. 
     &&  -- logical AND -- makes statement true only when both the conditions are true.
     ||  -- logical OR -- makes statement false only if both the statements are false
     !  -- logical NOT -- makes statement false when condition is true and vice versa

  4. increment and decrement : increment and decrement operators are used with single operand and they are used to increase/decrease the value by 1
     ++ <--> used for increement (increase the value by 1)
     -- <--> used for decrement (decrease the value by 1 )
     They have two variations such pre and post
     pre increment (++a): it increases the value and returns it
     post increement(a++): it returns the values and then increases
     pre decrement(--a): it decreases the value and returns it
     post decrement(a--): it returns the values and then decreases

   5. assignment operators: These operators are used to assign a value.
      a+=2 => a=a+2;
      a-=2 => a=a-2;
      a*=2 => a=a*2;
      a/=2 => a=a/2;
      a%=2 => a=a%2;
      a**=2 =>a=a**2;
    
   6. conditional or ternary operator: This operator work with three operands and used to flip statements based on a condition

   a=5,b=3;
   let c= a>b ? a : b;
